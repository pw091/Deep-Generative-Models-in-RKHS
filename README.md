# AMATH 563 Final Project - Deep Generative Models as Kernels
Supporting code and a [written report](final_report.pdf) for a thorough analysis of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and flow-based models expressed as transport maps parameterized within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The robust mathematical construction of neural network-based generative models in this setting was the main objective; the PyTorch implementations of VAE and flow-based models on MNIST serve as a complementary empirical component.

## Models
[models/](models) contains architectures developed for use in this project.

- VAE: Variational Autoencoders [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf)
  - *Primary contributor:* [pw091](https://github.com/pw091)

- NICE: Nonlinear Independent Components Estimation [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8516.pdf)

## Notebooks
[notebooks/](notebooks) contains unrefined Jupyter notebooks used for exploration and plotting.
- [cvae_pytorch.ipynb](notebooks/cvae_pytorch.ipynb) and [nice_pytorch.ipynb](notebooks/nice_pytorch.ipynb) correspond to the above models and respective contributors.
- [kernel_mmd.ipynb](notebooks/kernel_mmd.ipynb) (mean maximum discrepancy) [[jmlr]](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf) was intended to complement our analysis of the other models but was abandoned early due to report length constraints.
