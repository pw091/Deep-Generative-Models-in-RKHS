# AMATH 563 Final Project - Deep Generative Models as Kernels
Supporting code and a [written report](final_report.pdf) for a thorough analysis of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and flow-based models expressed as transport maps parameterized within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The robust mathematical construction of neural network-based generative models in this setting was the main objective; the PyTorch implementations of VAE and flow-based models on MNIST serve as a complementary empirical component.
