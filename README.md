# AMATH 563 Final Project - Deep Generative Models as Kernels
Supporting code and written report for a thorough analysis of variational autoencoders and flow-based models expressed as transport maps parameterized within an RKHS. The VAE and flow-based models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on MNIST. This was the final project submission for the Spring 2023 offering of AMATH 563: Inferring Structure of Complex Systems.
