# AMATH 563 Final Project - Deep Generative Models as Kernels
Supporting code and written report for a thorough analysis of variational autoencoders and flow-based models expressed as transport maps parameterized within an RKHS. The VAE and flow-based models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on MNIST.

## Models

### VAE: Variational Autoencoders [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf)
- Implemented in models/vae directory

### NICE: Nonlinear Independent Components Estimation [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8516.pdf)
- Implemented in models/nice directory

#### Generated Samples
